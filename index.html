              <h3>Who's that Pokemon!?</h3>
              <p>
                This application was built to provide nostalgia for users who
                love Pokemon and especially loved guessing who the pokemon was
                during the early Pokemon seasons! This application is a guessing
                game where users will be shown a Pokemon and have to fill in the
                blanks that will be the Pokemons name.. If guessed correctly
                then they can keep going to see if they can prove to be a
                Pokemon master!

              <p>
                One of our biggest challenges on this was building the
                functionality game. As this was the first group project from the
                bootcamp. With little experience in programming, it was a huge
                learning curve having to put the functionality of the game
                together. This is where we learned how to use Google and
                StackOverflow!

              <h3>Flower Tetris</h3>
              <p>
                A web application that is a tetris replica. This website allows
                the user to play tetris and save their score to a SQL database
                but only after creating an account.

              <p>
                We had a couple of challenges that stumped us through out this
                project. One of them being a challenge to understand how Tetris
                logic. Through this project I learned a lot about how much you
                can do with arrays and loops!
              </p>
              <p>Another challenge that stumped us was routing.</p>

              <h3>DreamScape</h3>
              <p>
                This was my first group MERN stack project built to allow users
                to create a dream-like environment though their own slides. This
                was created with a focus towards mental health and wellness.
                Within the story slides users can change background images and
                can choose to add text or use on of our pre-made poems and
                haikus!

              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p>
                One of the biggest challenge on this project we had was with
                JSON web-tokens.. Since this application requires that users log
                into the website before interacting with it.. It created a
                barrier towards the end where we had trouble getting valid
                tokens to create accounts and login.
